<h3>What is the best time to visit Bhandardara?</h3>

<h2>3.KALSUBAI PEAK</h2>
<img src="photos/kalsubai.jpg">
<h3>Kalsubai Peak, Bhandardara Overview</h3>
<p>Mt. Kalsubai is the highest peak of the Sahyadri Ranges. The view of this majestic mountain is an amazing sight in Bhandardara. It is also known as the Everest of Maharashtra, as it is the highest peak in the state.

The trek is a very tricky one and usually the experienced trekkers find their way to the top with some difficulty. There are now man-made stairs to reach the peak if you don't wish to trek. However, the hills near the Kalsubai peak are relatively easier to scale.</p>
<h3>Trek Routes </h3>
<p>ase village, we need to move in the direction of the peak till we come across a stream of water. After crossing the stream, we come across a small temple. The route which goes up from behind this temple terminates at the top of the fort. The local villagers have put up three large ladders to make the entire trek easier. After climbing through two ladders, we reach a small plateau and a well adjoining it. The climb through the third ladder from this point is a simple affair from this point. This last ladder takes us to the peak of the fort.</p>

<img src="photos/vipassana.jpg">
<h3>Welcome to Dhamma Giri - Vipassana International Academy</h3>
<p>Dhamma Giri, meaning �Hill of Dhamma�, is one of the world�s largest meditation centres and the main centre of a rapidly growing global Vipassana organization. It is dedicated to the teaching of Vipassana Meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin.</p>
<h3>What is Vipassana?</h3>
<p>Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are, is one of India's most ancient techniques of meditation. It was taught in India more than 2500 years ago as a universal remedy for universal ills, an Art of Living.
Vipassana is the process of self-purification by self-observation. One begins by observing the natural breath to concentrate the mind. Then, with a sharpened awareness, one proceeds to observe the changing nature of body and mind and experiences the universal truths of impermanence, suffering and egolessness. This truth-realization by direct experience results in mental purification.</p>
<h3>Centre Location</h3>
<p>Dhamma Giri is situated in the town of Igatpuri which is 45 km away from Nashik and 136 km away from Mumbai, on Mumbai-Agra Highway. It is well connected by central railway line. Geographically it is situated 20 N latitude and 74 E Longitude and altitude of 599 m above mean sea level. For more information on Dhamma Giri visit The Centre Page.</p>
